# Flashcard

## Flashcards

## Lab 2

### App Description
Currently, flashcard app is able to add flashcards and edit existing flashcards. By adding a new view controller that handles the creation of new flashcards and the editing existing flashcards, the user is navigated to a new screen in which they can either fill in the appropriate text fields and hit "Done" or hit "Cancel" if they change their mind and want to return to the previous screen. If the user doesn't enter anything on any of the text fields and hits "Done", an error message will pop up letting them know that they need to enter something in the text fields.
